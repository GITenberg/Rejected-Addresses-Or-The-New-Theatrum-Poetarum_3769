<span class="GutSmall">THE TWENTY-SECOND EDITION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">James Smith</span> and <span
class="smcap">Horace Smith</span>, authors of the <i>Rejected
Addresses</i>; or, <i>The New Theatrum Poetarum</i>, were the
sons of Robert Smith, solicitor to the Board of Ordnance.&nbsp;
James was born at No. 36, Basinghall Street, London, on the 10th
of February, 1775; and Horace in the same house on the 31st of
December, 1779.</p>
<p>James was educated under the Rev. Mr. Burford at Chigwell in
Essex; articled to his father on leaving school, subsequently
taken into partnership with him, and eventually succeeded to his
father&rsquo;s business, as well as his appointment of solicitor
to the Ordnance.&nbsp; Horace received the same education as his
brother, became a member of the Stock Exchange in London,
acquired a fortune, and retired with his wife and family to
Brighton.&nbsp; James, who lived and died single, was the author
of several small copies of verses, since collected by his
brother; and Horace was the author of &ldquo;Brambletye
House,&rdquo; a novel in three volumes, well received at the time
of its publication.</p>
<p>The work by which the brothers are best known, and by which
they will long continue to be remembered, is the <i>Rejected
Addresses</i>.&nbsp; This delightful volume&mdash;one of the
luckiest hits in literature&mdash;appeared on the re-opening of
Drury Lane Theatre, in October, 1812; the idea, as Horace
relates, having been casualty started by the late Mr. Ward,
secretary to the theatre, exactly six weeks before the night when
the opening Address was to be spoken.&nbsp; The hint thus <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>thrown out
was eagerly adopted.&nbsp; The brothers arranged what authors
they should respectively imitate; and James executed his portion
in London, and Horace the remainder at Cheltenham.&nbsp; James
supplied the imitations of Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge,
Crabbe, and Cobbett, and Nos. 14, 16, 18, 19, and 20.&nbsp; The
Byron was a joint effusion&mdash;James contributing the first
stanza, and Horace the remainder.&nbsp; The Fitzgerald, the Sir
Walter Scott, &amp;c., were by Horace.&nbsp; The corrections
which each supplied to the compositions of the other seldom
exceeded verbal alterations or the addition of a few lines.</p>
<p>The copyright, which had been originally offered to Mr. Murray
for 20<i>l.</i>, and refused without even looking at the MS., <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a> was purchased by that gentleman in
1819, after the book had run through sixteen editions, for
131<i>l.</i></p>
<p>James Smith died at his house, No. 27, Craven Street, Strand,
on the 24th December, 1839, in the 65th year of his age; and was
buried in the vaults of the church of St. Martin&rsquo;s in the
Fields.&nbsp; Horace died at Tunbridge Wells, on the 12th of
July, 1849, in the 70th year of his age, and was buried in the
churchyard of Trinity Church, Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>PREFACE
TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 14th of August, 1812, the
following advertisement appeared in most of the daily
papers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Rebuilding of
Drury Lane Theatre</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Committee are desirous of promoting a free and fair
competition for an Address to be spoken upon the opening of the
Theatre, which will take place on the 10th of October next.&nbsp;
They have, therefore, thought fit to announce to the public, that
they will be glad to receive any such compositions, addressed to
their Secretary, at the Treasury-office, in Drury Lane, on or
before the 10th of September, sealed up, with a distinguishing
word, number, or motto, on the cover, corresponding with the
inscription on a separate sealed paper, containing the name of
the author, which will not be opened unless containing the name
of the successful candidate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the propriety of this plan men&rsquo;s minds were, as
they usually are upon matters of moment, much divided.&nbsp; Some
thought it a fair promise of the future intention of the
Committee to abolish that phalanx of authors who usurp the stage,
to the exclusion of a large assortment of dramatic talent
blushing unseen in the background; while others contended that
the scheme would prevent men of real eminence from descending
into an amphitheatre in which all Grub Street (that is to say,
all London and Westminster) would be arrayed against them.&nbsp;
The event has proved both parties to be in a degree right, and in
a degree wrong.&nbsp; One hundred and twelve <i>Addresses</i>
have been sent in, each sealed <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>and signed, and mottoed, &ldquo;as
per order,&rdquo; some written by men of great, some by men of
little, and some by men of no talent.</p>
<p>Many of the public prints have censured the taste of the
Committee, in thus contracting for <i>Addresses</i> as they would
for nails&mdash;by the gross; but it is surprising that none
should have censured their <i>temerity</i>.&nbsp; One hundred and
eleven of the <i>Addresses</i> must, of course, be unsuccessful:
to each of the authors, thus infallibly classed with the <i>genus
irritabile</i>, it would be very hard to deny six stanch friends,
who consider his the best of all possible <i>Addresses</i>, and
whose tongues will be as ready to laud him as to hiss his
adversary.&nbsp; These, with the potent aid of the bard himself,
make seven foes per address; and thus will be created seven
hundred and seventy-seven implacable auditors, prepared to
condemn the strains of Apollo himself&mdash;a band of adversaries
which no prudent manager would think of exasperating.</p>
<p>But, leaving the Committee to encounter the responsibility
they have incurred, the public have at least to thank them for
ascertaining and establishing one point, which might otherwise
have admitted of controversy.&nbsp; When it is considered that
many amateur writers have been discouraged from becoming
competitors, and that few, if any, of the professional authors
can afford to write for nothing, and, of course, have not been
candidates for the honorary prize at Drury Lane, we may
confidently pronounce that, as far as regards <i>number</i>, the
present is undoubtedly the Augustan age of English poetry.&nbsp;
Whether or not this distinction will be extended to the
<i>quality</i> of its productions, must be decided at the
tribunal of posterity; though the natural anxiety of our authors
on this score ought to be considerably diminished when they
reflect how few will, in all probability, be had up for
judgment.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for the Editor to mention the manner in
which he became possessed of this &ldquo;fair sample of the
present state of poetry in Great Britain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was his
first intention to publish the whole; but a little reflection
convinced him that, by so doing, he might depress the good,
without elevating <a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>the bad.&nbsp; He has therefore culled what had the
appearance of flowers, from what possessed the reality of weeds,
and is extremely sorry that, in so doing, he has diminished his
collection to twenty-one.&nbsp; Those which he has rejected may
possibly make their appearance in a separate volume, or they may
be admitted as volunteers in the files of some of the newspapers;
or, at all events, they are sure of being received among the
awkward squad of the Magazines.&nbsp; In general, they bear a
close resemblance to each other; thirty of them contain
extravagant compliments to the immortal Wellington and the
indefatigable Whitbread; and, as the last-mentioned gentleman is
said to dislike praise in the exact proportion in which he
deserves it, these laudatory writers have probably been only
building a wall against which they might run their own heads.</p>
<p>The Editor here begs leave to advance a few words in behalf of
that useful and much abused bird the Phoenix; and in so doing he
is biassed by no partiality, as he assures the reader he not only
never saw one, but (<i>mirabile dictu</i>!) never caged one, in a
simile, in the whole course of his life.&nbsp; Not less than
sixty-nine of the competitors have invoked the aid of this native
of Arabia; but as, from their manner of using him after they had
caught him, he does not by any means appear to have been a native
of Arabia <i>Felix</i>, the Editor has left the proprietors to
treat with Mr. Polito, and refused to receive this <i>rara
avis</i>, or black swan, into the present collection.&nbsp; One
exception occurs, in which the admirable treatment of this
feathered incombustible entitles the author to great praise: that
Address has been preserved, and in the ensuing pages takes the
lead, to which its dignity entitles it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason why several of the subjoined productions of
the <span class="smcap">Mus&aelig; Londinenses</span> have failed
of selection, may be discovered in their being penned in a metre
unusual upon occasions of this sort, and in their not being
written with that attention to stage effect, the want of which,
like want of manners in the concerns of life, is more prejudicial
<a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>than a
deficiency of talent.&nbsp; There is an art of writing for the
Theatre, technically called <i>touch</i> and <i>go</i>, which is
indispensable when we consider the small quantum of patience
which so motley an assemblage as a London audience can be
expected to afford.&nbsp; All the contributors have been very
exact in sending their initials and mottoes.&nbsp; Those
belonging to the present collection have been carefully
preserved, and each has been affixed to its respective
poem.&nbsp; The letters that accompanied the Addresses having
been honourably destroyed unopened, it is impossible to state the
real authors with any certainty; but the ingenious reader, after
comparing the initials with the motto, and both with the poem,
may form his own conclusions.</p>
<p>The Editor does not anticipate any disapprobation from thus
giving publicity to a small portion of the <i>Rejected
Addresses</i>; for unless he is widely mistaken in assigning the
respective authors, the fame of each individual is established on
much too firm a basis to be shaken by so trifling and evanescent
a publication as the present:</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; neque ego illi detrahere ausim<br />
H&aelig;rentem capiti mult&acirc; cum laude coronam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the numerous pieces already sent to the Committee for
performance, he has only availed himself of three vocal
Travesties, which he has selected, not for their merit, but
simply for their brevity.&nbsp; Above one hundred spectacles,
melodramas, operas, and pantomimes have been transmitted, besides
the two first acts of one legitimate comedy.&nbsp; Some of these
evince considerable smartness of manual dialogue, and several
brilliant repartees of chairs, tables, and other inanimate wits;
but the authors seem to have forgotten that in the new Drury Lane
the audience can hear as well as see.&nbsp; Of late our theatres
have been so constructed, that John Bull has been compelled to
have very long ears, or none at all; to keep them dangling about
his skull like discarded servants, while his eyes were gazing at
pieballs and elephants, or else to stretch them out to an asinine
length to catch the congenial sound of braying trumpets.&nbsp; An
auricular revolution is, we <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>trust, about to take place; and as
many people have been much puzzled to define the meaning of the
new era, of which we have heard so much, we venture to pronounce
that, as far as regards Drury Lane Theatre, the new era means the
reign of ears.&nbsp; If the past affords any pledge for the
future, we may confidently expect from the Committee of that
House every thing that can be accomplished by the union of taste
and assiduity.</p>
<blockquote><p>[&ldquo;We have no conjectures to offer as to the
anonymous author of this amusing little volume.&nbsp; He who is
such a master of disguises may easily be supposed to have been
successful in concealing himself, and, with the power of assuming
so many styles, is not likely to be detected by his own.&nbsp; We
should guess, however, that he had not written a great deal in
his own character&mdash;that his natural style was neither very
lofty nor very grave&mdash;and that he rather indulges a
partiality for puns and verbal pleasantries.&nbsp; We marvel why
he has shut out Campbell and Rogers from his theatre of living
poets, and confidently expect to have our curiosity, in this and
in all other particulars, very speedily gratified, when the
applause of the country shall induce him to take off his
mask.&rdquo;]</p>

<span class="GutSmall">TO</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">EIGHTEENTH EDITION.</span> <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the present publishing era, when
books are like the multitudinous waves of the advancing sea, some
of which make no impression whatever upon the sand, while the
superficial traces left by others are destined to be perpetually
obliterated by their successors, almost as soon as they are
found, the authors of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> may well feel
flattered, after a lapse of twenty years, and the sale of
seventeen large editions, in receiving an application to write a
Preface to a new and more handsome impression.&nbsp; In
diminution, however, of any overweening vanity which they might
be disposed to indulge on this occasion, they cannot but admit
the truth of the remark made by a particularly candid and
good-natured friend, who kindly reminded them, that if their
little work has hitherto floated upon the stream of time, while
so many others of much greater weight and value have sunk to rise
no more, it has been solely indebted for its buoyancy to that
specific levity which enables feathers, straws, and similar
trifles to defer their submersion until they have become
thoroughly saturated with the waters of oblivion, when they
quickly meet the fate which they had long before merited.</p>
<p>Our ingenuous and ingenious friend furthermore observed, <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>that the
demolition of Drury Lane Theatre by fire, its reconstruction
under the auspices of the celebrated Mr. Whitbread, <a
name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a> the reward offered by the Committee for
an opening address, and the public recitation of a poem composed
expressly for the occasion by Lord Byron, one of the most popular
writers of the age, formed an extraordinary concurrence of
circumstances which could not fail to insure the success of the
<i>Rejected Addresses</i>, while it has subsequently served to
fix them in the memory of the public, so far at least as a poor
immortality of twenty years can be said to have effected that
object.&nbsp; In fact, continued our impartial and affectionate
monitor, your little work owes its present obscure existence
entirely to the accidents that have surrounded and embalmed
it,&mdash;even as flies, and other worthless insects, may long
survive their natural date of extinction, if they chance to be
preserved in amber, or any similar substance.</p>
<blockquote><p>The things, we know, are neither rich nor
rare&mdash;<br />
But wonder how the devil they got there!&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Pope</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the natural affection of parents for the offspring of
their own brains, we ventured to hint that some portion of our
success might perhaps be attributable to the manner in which the
different imitations were executed; but our worthy friend
protested that his sincere regard for us, as well as for the
cause of truth, compelled him to reject our claim, and to
pronounce that, when once the idea had been conceived, all the
rest followed as a matter of course, and might have been executed
by any other hands not less felicitously than by our own.</p>
<p>Willingly leaving this matter to the decision of the public,
since we cannot be umpires in our own cause, we proceed to detail
such circumstances attending the writing and publication of our
little work, as may literally meet the wishes of the present
proprietor of the copyright, who has applied to us for a
gossiping Preface.&nbsp; Were we disposed to be grave <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>and
didactic, which is as foreign to our mood as it was twenty years
ago, we might draw the attention of the reader, in a fine
sententious paragraph, to the trifles upon which the fate of
empires, as well as a four-and-sixpenny volume of parodies,
occasionally hangs in trembling balance.&nbsp; No sooner was the
idea of our work conceived, than it was about to be abandoned in
embryo, from the apprehension that we had no lime to mature and
bring it forth, as it was indispensable that it should be
written, printed, and published by the opening of Drury Lane
Theatre, which would only allow us an interval of six weeks, and
we had both of us other avocations that precluded us from the
full command of even that limited period.&nbsp; Encouraged,
however, by the conviction that the thought was a good one, and
by the hope of making a lucky hit, we set to work <i>con
amore</i>, our very hurry not improbably enabling us to strike
out at a heat what we might have failed to produce so well, had
we possessed time enough to hammer it into more careful and
elaborate form.</p>
<p>Our first difficulty, that of selection, was by no means a
light one.&nbsp; Some of our most eminent poets&mdash;such, for
instance, as Rogers and Campbell&mdash;presented so much beauty,
harmony, and proportion in their writings, both as to style and
sentiment, that if we had attempted to caricature them, nobody
would have recognised the likeness; and if we had endeavoured to
give a servile copy of their manner, it would only have amounted,
at best, to a tame and unamusing portrait, which it was not our
object to present.&nbsp; Although fully aware that their names
would, in the theatrical phrase, have conferred great strength
upon our bill, we were reluctantly compelled to forego them, and
to confine ourselves to writers whose style and habit of thought,
being more marked and peculiar, was more capable of exaggeration
and distortion.&nbsp; To avoid politics and personality, to
imitate the turn of mind as well as the phraseology of our
originals, and, at all events, to raise a harmless laugh, were
our main objects; in the attainment of which united aims, we were
sometimes hurried into extravagance, by attaching much more
importance <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>to the last than to the two first.&nbsp; In no
instance were we thus betrayed into a greater injustice than in
the case of Mr. Wordsworth&mdash;the touching sentiment, profound
wisdom, and copious harmony of whose loftier writings we left
unnoticed, in the desire of burlesquing them; while we pounced
upon his popular ballads, and exerted ourselves to push their
simplicity into puerility and silliness.&nbsp; With pride and
pleasure do we now claim to be ranked among the most ardent
admirers of this true poet; and if he himself could see the state
of his works, which are ever at our right hand, he would,
perhaps, receive the manifest evidences they exhibit of constant
reference and delighted re-perusal, as some sort of <i>amende
honorable</i> for the unfairness of which we were guilty when we
were less conversant with the higher inspirations of his
muse.&nbsp; To Mr. Coleridge, and others of our originals, we
must also do a tardy act of justice, by declaring that our
burlesque of their peculiarities has never blinded us to those
beauties and talents which are beyond the reach of all
ridicule.</p>
<p>One of us <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a> had written a genuine Address for the
occasion, which was sent to the Committee, and shared the fate it
merited, in being rejected.&nbsp; To swell the bulk, or rather to
diminish the tenuity of our little work, we added it to the
Imitations; and prefixing the initials of S. T. P. for the
purpose of puzzling the critics, were not a little amused, in the
sequel, by the many guesses and conjectures into which we had
ensnared some of our readers.&nbsp; We could even enjoy the
mysticism, qualified as it was by the poor compliment, that our
carefully written Address exhibited no &ldquo;very prominent
trait of absurdity,&rdquo; when we saw it thus noticed in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> for November 1812:&mdash;&ldquo;An
Address by S. T. P. we can make nothing of; and professing our
ignorance of the <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>author designated by these letters, we can only add,
that the Address, though a little affected, and not very full of
meaning, has no very prominent trait of absurdity, that we can
detect; and might have been adopted and spoken, so far as we can
perceive, without any hazard of ridicule.&nbsp; In our simplicity
we consider it as a very decent, mellifluous, occasional
prologue; and do not understand how it has found its way into its
present company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urged forward by hurry, and trusting to chance, two very bad
coadjutors in any enterprise, we at length congratulated
ourselves on having completed our task in time to have it printed
and published by the opening of the theatre.&nbsp; But alas! our
difficulties, so far from being surmounted, seemed only to be
beginning.&nbsp; Strangers to the arcana of the
booksellers&rsquo; trade, and unacquainted with their almost
invincible objection to single volumes of low price, especially
when tendered by writers who have acquired no previous name, we
little anticipated that they would refuse to publish our
<i>Rejected Addresses</i>, even although we asked nothing for the
copyright.&nbsp; Such, however, proved to be the case.&nbsp; Our
manuscript was perused and returned to us by several of the most
eminent publishers. <a name="citation0e"></a><a
href="#footnote0e" class="citation">[0e]</a>&nbsp; Well do we
remember betaking ourselves to one of the craft in Bond-street,
whom we found in a back parlour, with his gouty leg propped upon
a cushion, in spite of which warning he diluted his luncheon with
frequent glasses of Madeira.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you already
written?&rdquo; was his first question&mdash;an interrogatory to
which we had been subjected in almost every instance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing by which we can be known.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
I am afraid to undertake <a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>the publication.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
presumed timidly to suggest that every writer must have a
beginning, and that to refuse to publish for him until he had
acquired a name, was to imitate the sapient mother who cautioned
her son against going into the water until he could swim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An old joke&mdash;a regular Joe!&rdquo; exclaimed our
companion, tossing off another bumper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still older
than Joe Miller,&rdquo; was our reply; &ldquo;for, if we mistake
not, it is the very first anecdote in the faceti&aelig; of
Hierocles.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, sirs!&rdquo; resumed the
bibliopolist, &ldquo;you are learned, are you?&nbsp; So,
sob!&mdash;Well, leave your manuscript with me; I will look it
over to-night, and give you an answer to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Punctual as the clock we presented ourselves at his door on the
following morning, when our papers were returned to us with the
observation&mdash;&ldquo;These trifles are really not deficient
in smartness; they are well, vastly well, for beginners; but they
will never do&mdash;never.&nbsp; They would not pay for
advertising, and without it I should not sell fifty
copies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was discouraging enough.&nbsp; If the most experienced
publishers feared to be out of pocket by the work, it was
manifest, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, that its writers ran a risk
of being still more heavy losers, should they undertake the
publication on their own account.&nbsp; We had no objection to
raise a laugh at the expense of others; but to do it at our own
cost, uncertain as we were to what extent we might be involved,
had never entered into our contemplation.&nbsp; In this dilemma,
our <i>Addresses</i>, now in every sense rejected, might probably
have never seen the light, had not some good angel whispered us
to betake ourselves to Mr. John Miller, a dramatic publisher,
then residing in Bow Street, Covent Garden.&nbsp; No sooner had
this gentleman looked over our manuscript, than he immediately
offered to take upon himself all the risk of publication, and to
give us half the profits, <i>should there be any</i>; a liberal
proposition, with which we gladly closed.&nbsp; So rapid and
decided was its success, at which none were more unfeignedly
astonished than its authors, that Mr. Miller advised us to
collect some <i>Imitations of Horace</i>, which had appeared
anonymously <a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvi</span>in the <i>Monthly Mirror</i>, <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a> offering to publish them upon the same
terms.&nbsp; We did so accordingly; and as new editions of the
<i>Rejected Addresses</i> were called for in quick succession, we
were shortly enabled to sell our half copyright in the two works
to Mr. Miller for one thousand pounds!&nbsp; We have entered into
this unimportant detail, not to gratify any vanity of our own,
but to encourage such literary beginners as may be placed in
similar circumstances; as well as to impress upon publishers the
propriety of giving more consideration to the possible merit of
the works submitted to them, than to the mere magic of a
name.</p>
<p>To the credit of the <i>genus irritabile</i> be it recorded,
that not one of those whom we had parodied or burlesqued ever
betrayed the least soreness on the occasion, or refused to join
in the laugh that we had occasioned.&nbsp; With most of them we
subsequently formed acquaintanceship; while some honoured us with
an intimacy which still continues, where it has not been severed
by the rude hand of Death.&nbsp; Alas! it is painful to reflect,
that of the twelve writers whom we presumed to imitate, five are
now no more; the list of the deceased being unhappily swelled by
the most illustrious of all, the <i>clarum et venerabile
nomen</i> of Sir Walter Scott!&nbsp; From that distinguished
writer, whose transcendent talents were only to be equalled by
his virtues and his amiability, we received favours and notice,
both public and private, which it will be difficult to forget,
because we had not the smallest claim upon his kindness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I certainly must have written this myself!&rdquo; said
that fine-tempered man to one of the authors, pointing to the
description of the Fire, &ldquo;although I forget upon what
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lydia White, <a name="citation0g"></a><a
href="#footnote0g" class="citation">[0g]</a> a literary lady who
was prone to <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>feed the lions of the day, invited one of us to
dinner; but, recollecting afterwards that William Spencer <a
name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a> formed one of the party, wrote to the
latter to put him off, telling him that a man was to be at her
table whom he &ldquo;would not like to meet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray, who is this whom I should not like to meet?&rdquo;
inquired the poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;O!&rdquo; answered the lady,
&ldquo;one of those men who have made that shameful attack upon
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The very man upon earth I should like to
know!&rdquo; rejoined the lively and careless bard.&nbsp; The two
individuals accordingly met, and have continued fast friends ever
since.&nbsp; Lord Byron, too, wrote thus to Mr. Murray from
Italy&mdash;&ldquo;Tell him I forgive him, were he twenty times
over our satirist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may not be amiss to notice, in this place, one criticism of
a Leicestershire clergyman, which may be pronounced unique:
&ldquo;I do not see why they should have been rejected,&rdquo;
observed the matter-of-fact annotator; &ldquo;I think some of
them very good!&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the whole, few have been the
instances, in the acrimonious history of literature, where a
malicious pleasantry like the <i>Rejected
Addresses</i>&mdash;which the parties ridiculed might well
consider more annoying than a direct satire&mdash;instead of
being met by querulous bitterness or petulant retaliation, has
procured for its authors the acquaintance, or conciliated the
good-will, of those whom they had the most audaciously
burlesqued.</p>
<p>In commenting on a work, however trifling, which has survived
the lapse of twenty years, an author may almost claim the
privileged garrulity of age; yet even in a professedly gossiping
Preface, we begin to fear that we are exceeding our commission,
and abusing the patience of the reader.&nbsp; If we are doing so,
we might urge extenuating circumstances, which will explain,
though they may not excuse, our diffuseness.&nbsp; To one of us
the totally unexpected success of this little work proved an
important event, since it mainly decided him, some years
afterwards, to embark in the literary career which the continued
favour of that novel-reading world <a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>has rendered both pleasant and
profitable to him.&nbsp; This is the first, as it will probably
be the last, occasion upon which we shall ever intrude ourselves
personally on the public notice; and we trust that our now doing
so will stand excused by the reasons we have adduced.</p>

HAMPSHIRE FARMER&rsquo;S ADDRESS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">By</span> W.
C.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<span class="GutSmall">WILLIAM
CORBETT.</span>]</p>

aged 73.]</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>TO THE SECRETARY OF THE MANAGING COMMITTEE OF DRURY-LANE
PLAYHOUSE.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>To the gewgaw fetters of <i>rhyme</i> (invented by the monks
to enslave the people) I have a rooted objection.&nbsp; I have
therefore written an address for your Theatre in plain, homespun,
yeoman&rsquo;s prose; in the doing whereof I hope I am swayed by
nothing but an <i>independent</i> wish to open the eyes of this
gulled people, to prevent a repetition of the dramatic
<i>bamboozling</i> they have hitherto laboured under.&nbsp; If
you like what I have done, and mean to make use of it, I
don&rsquo;t want any such <i>aristocratic</i> reward as a piece
of plate with two griffins sprawling upon it, or a <i>dog</i> and
a <i>jackass</i> fighting for a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;worth of <i>gilt
gingerbread</i>, or any such Bartholomew-fair nonsense.&nbsp; All
I ask is that the door-keepers of your play-house may take all
the <i>sets of my Register</i> <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a> now on hand, and
<i>force</i> every body who enters your doors to buy one, giving
afterwards a debtor and creditor account of what they have
received, <i>post-paid</i>, <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and in due course remitting me the
money and unsold Registers, <i>carriage-paid</i>.</p>

Et sparsit virides spumis albentibus agrot.&rdquo;&mdash;<span

<p><span class="smcap">Most thinking People</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> persons address an audience
from the stage, it is usual, either in words or gesture, to say,
&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, your servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I were
base enough, mean enough, paltry enough, and <i>brute beast</i>
enough, to follow that fashion, I should tell two lies in a
breath.&nbsp; In the first place, you are <i>not</i> Ladies and
Gentlemen, but I hope something better, that is to say, honest
men and women; and in the next place, if you were ever so much
ladies, and ever so much gentlemen, I am not, <i>nor ever will
be</i>, your humble servant.&nbsp; You see me here, <i>most
thinking people</i>, by mere chance.&nbsp; I have not been within
the doors of a play-house before for these ten years; nor, till
that abominable custom of taking money at the doors is
discontinued, will I ever sanction a theatre with my
presence.&nbsp; The stage-door is the only gate of <i>freedom</i>
in the whole edifice, and through that I made my way from
Bagshaw&rsquo;s <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> in Brydges Street, to accost you.&nbsp;
Look about you.&nbsp; Are you not all comfortable?&nbsp; Nay,
never slink, mun; speak out, if you are dissatisfied, and tell me
so before I leave town.&nbsp; You are now (thanks to <i>Mr.
Whitbread</i>) got into a large, comfortable house.&nbsp; Not
into a <i>gimcrack-palace</i>; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>not into a <i>Solomon&rsquo;s
temple</i>; not into a frost-work of Brobdignag filigree; but
into a plain, honest, homely, industrious, wholesome, <i>brown
brick playhouse</i>.&nbsp; You have been struggling for
independence and elbow-room these three years; and who gave it
you?&nbsp; Who helped you out of Lilliput?&nbsp; Who routed you
from a rat-hole five inches by four, to perch you in a
palace?&nbsp; Again and again I answer, <i>Mr.
Whitbread</i>.&nbsp; You might have sweltered in that place with
the Greek name <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> till doomsday, and neither <i>Lord
Castlereagh</i>, <i>Mr. Canning</i>, no, nor the <i>Marquess
Wellesley</i>, would have turned a trowel to help you out!&nbsp;
Remember that.&nbsp; Never forget that.&nbsp; Read it to your
children, and to your children&rsquo;s children!&nbsp; And now,
<i>most thinking people</i>, cast your eyes over my head to what
the builder (I beg his pardon, the architect) calls the
<i>proscenium</i>.&nbsp; No motto, no slang, no popish Latin, to
keep the people in the dark.&nbsp; No <i>veluti in
speculum</i>.&nbsp; Nothing in the dead languages, properly so
called, for they ought to die, ay and be <i>damned</i> to
boot!&nbsp; The Covent Garden manager tried that, and a pretty
business he made of it!&nbsp; When a man says <i>veluti in
speculum</i>, he is called a man of letters.&nbsp; Very well, and
is not a man who cries O. P. a man of letters too?&nbsp; You ran
your O. P. against his <i>veluti in speculum</i>, and pray which
beat?&nbsp; I prophesied that, though I never told any
body.&nbsp; I take it for granted, that every intelligent man,
woman, and child, to whom I address myself, has stood severally
and respectively in Little Russell Street, and cast their, his,
her, and its eyes on the outside of this building before they
paid their money to view the inside.&nbsp; Look at the
brick-work, <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span><i>English Audience</i>!&nbsp; Look at the
brick-work!&nbsp; All plain and smooth like a quakers&rsquo;
meeting.&nbsp; None of your Egyptian pyramids, to entomb
subscribers&rsquo; capitals.&nbsp; No overgrown colonnades of
stone, <a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> like an alderman&rsquo;s gouty legs in
white cotton stockings, fit only to use as rammers for paving
Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; This house is neither after the model
of a temple in Athens, no, nor a <i>temple</i> in
<i>Moorfields</i>, but it is built to act English plays in: and,
provided you have good scenery, dresses, and decorations, I
daresay you wouldn&rsquo;t break your hearts if the outside were
as plain as the pikestaff I used to carry when I was a
sergeant.&nbsp; <i>Apropos</i>, as the French valets say, who cut
their masters&rsquo; throats <a name="citation23b"></a><a
href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a>&mdash;<i>apropos</i>, a word about
dresses.&nbsp; You must, many of you, have seen what I have read
a description of, Kemble and Mrs. Siddons in Macbeth, with more
gold and silver plastered on their doublets than would have kept
an honest family in butchers&rsquo; meat and flannel from
year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end!&nbsp; I am informed, (now
mind, I do not vouch for the fact), but I am informed that all
such extravagant idleness is to be done away with here.&nbsp;
Lady Macbeth is to have a plain quilted petticoat, a cotton gown,
and a <i>mob cap</i> (as the court parasites call it;&mdash;it
will be well for them if, one of these days, they don&rsquo;t
wear a mob cap&mdash;I mean a <i>white cap</i>, with a <i>mob</i>
to look at them); and Macbeth is to appear in an honest
yeoman&rsquo;s drab coat, and a pair of black calamanco
breeches.&nbsp; Not <i>Sala</i>manca; no, nor <i>Talavera</i>
neither, my most Noble Marquess; but plain, honest, black
calamanco stuff <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>breeches.&nbsp; This is right; this is as it should
be.&nbsp; <i>Most thinking people</i>, I have heard you much
abused.&nbsp; There is not a compound in the language but is
strung fifty in a rope, like onions, by the Morning Post, and
hurled in your teeth.&nbsp; You are called the mob; and when they
have made you out to be the mob, you are called the <i>scum</i>
of the people, and the <i>dregs</i> of the people.&nbsp; I should
like to know how you can be both.&nbsp; Take a basin of
broth&mdash;not <i>cheap soup</i>, <i>Mr.
Wilberforce</i>&mdash;not soup for the poor, at a penny a quart,
as your mixture of horses&rsquo; legs, brick-dust, and old shoes,
was denominated&mdash;but plain, wholesome, patriotic beef or
mutton broth; take this, examine it, and you will
find&mdash;mind, I don&rsquo;t vouch for the fact, but I am
told&mdash;you will find the dregs at the bottom, and the scum at
the top.&nbsp; I will endeavour to explain this to you: England
is a large <i>earthenware pipkin</i>; John Bull is the
<i>beef</i> thrown into it; taxes are the <i>hot water</i> he
boils in; rotten boroughs are the <i>fuel</i> that blazes under
this same pipkin; parliament is the <i>ladle</i> that stirs the
hodge-podge, and sometimes&mdash;.&nbsp; But, hold!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t wish to pay <i>Mr. Newman</i> <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> a second visit.&nbsp; I leave you
better off than you have been this many a day: you have a good
house over your head; you have beat the French in Spain; the
harvest has turned out well; the comet keeps its distance; <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a> and red slippers are hawked about in
Constantinople for next to nothing; and for all this, <i>again
and again</i> I tell you, you are indebted to <i>Mr.

Flitted the silent midnight breeze,<br />
Curling the foliage as it pass&rsquo;d,<br />
Which from the moon-tipp&rsquo;d plumage cast<br />
A spangled light, like dancing spray,<br />
Then re-assumed its still array;<br />
When, as night&rsquo;s lamp unclouded hung,<br />
And down its full effulgence flung,<br />
It shed such soft and balmy power<br />
That cot and castle, hall and bower,<br />
And spire and dome, and turret height,<br />
Appeared to slumber in the light.<br />
From Henry&rsquo;s chapel, Rufus&rsquo; hall,<br />
To Savoy, Temple, and St. Paul;<br />
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>From
Knightsbridge, Pancras, Camden Town,<br />

No voice was heard, no eye unclosed,<br />
But all in deepest sleep reposed.<br />
They might have thought, who gazed around<br />
Amid a silence so profound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It made the senses thrill,<br />
That &rsquo;twas no place inhabited,<br />
But some vast city of the dead&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All was so hush&rsquo;d and still.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">THE BURNING.</p>
<p class="poetry">As Chaos, which, by heavenly doom,<br />
Had slept in everlasting gloom,<br />
Started with terror and surprise<br />
When light first flash&rsquo;d upon her eyes&mdash;<br />
So London&rsquo;s sons in nightcap woke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In bed-gown woke her dames;<br />
For shouts were heard &rsquo;mid fire and smoke,<br />
And twice ten hundred voices spoke&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The playhouse is in flames!&rdquo;<br />
And, lo! where Catherine Street extends,<br />
A fiery tail its lustre lends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To every window-pane;<br />
Blushes each spout in Martlet Court,<br />
And Barbican, moth-eaten fort,<br />
And Covent Garden kennels sport<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bright ensanguined drain;<br />
Meux&rsquo;s new brewhouse shows the light,<br />

Wright&rsquo;s shrimp and oyster shop withal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Richardson&rsquo;s Hotel.<br />
Nor these alone, but far and wide,<br />
Across red Thames&rsquo;s gleaming tide,<br />
To distant fields the blaze was borne,<br />
And daisy white and hoary thorn<br />
In borrow&rsquo;d lustre seem&rsquo;d to sham<br />
The rose or red sweet Wil-li-am.<br />
To those who on the hills around<br />
Beheld the flames from Drury&rsquo;s mound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As from a lofty altar rise,<br />
It seem&rsquo;d that nations did conspire<br />
To offer to the god of fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some vast, stupendous sacrifice!<br />
The summon&rsquo;d firemen woke at call,<br />
And hied them to their stations all:<br />
Starting from short and broken snooze,<br />
Each sought his pond&rsquo;rous hobnail&rsquo;d shoes,<br />
But first his worsted hosen plied,<br />
Plush breeches next, in crimson dyed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His nether bulk embraced;<br />
Then jacket thick, of red or blue,<br />
Whose massy shoulder gave to view<br />
The badge of each respective crew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>In tin or copper traced.<br />
The engines thunder&rsquo;d through the street,<br />
Fire-hook, pipe, bucket, all complete,<br />
And torches glared, and clattering feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the pavement paced.<br />
And one, the leader of the band,<br />
From Charing Cross along the Strand,<br />
Like stag by beagles hunted hard,<br />
Ran till he stopp&rsquo;d at Vin&rsquo;gar Yard. <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"

The burning badge his shoulder bore,<br />
The belt and oil-skin hat he wore,<br />
The cane he had, his men to bang,<br />
Show&rsquo;d foreman of the British gang&mdash;<br />
His name was Higginbottom.&nbsp; Now<br />
&rsquo;Tis meet that I should tell you how<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The others came in view:<br />
The Hand-in-Hand the race begun, <a name="citation46b"></a><a

Then came the Phoenix and the Sun,<br />
Th&rsquo; Exchange, where old insurers run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eagle, where the new;<br />
With these came Rumford, Bumford, Cole,<br />
Robins from Hockley in the Hole,<br />
Lawson and Dawson, cheek by jowl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crump from St. Giles&rsquo;s Pound:<br />
Whitford and Mitford join&rsquo;d the train,<br />
Huggins and Muggins from Chick Lane,<br />
And Clutterbuck, who got a sprain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Before the plug was found.<br />
Hobson and Jobson did not sleep,<br />
But ah! no trophy could they reap,<br />
For both were in the Donjon Keep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Bridewell&rsquo;s gloomy mound!</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en Higginbottom now was posed,<br />
For sadder scene was ne&rsquo;er disclosed<br />
Without, within, in hideous show,<br />
Devouring flames resistless glow,<br />
And blazing rafters downward go,<br />
And never halloo &ldquo;Heads below!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor notice give at all.<br />
The firemen terrified are slow<br />
To bid the pumping torrent flow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear the roof should fall.<br />
Back, Robins, back!&nbsp; Crump, stand aloof!<br />
Whitford, keep near the walls!<br />
Huggins, regard your own behoof,<br />
For, lo! the blazing rocking roof<br />
Down, down in thunder falls!<br />
An awful pause succeeds the stroke,<br />
And o&rsquo;er the ruins volumed smoke,<br />
Rolling around its pitchy shroud,<br />
Conceal&rsquo;d them from th&rsquo; astonish&rsquo;d crowd.<br />
At length the mist awhile was clear&rsquo;d,<br />
When lo! amid the wreck uprear&rsquo;d,<br />
Gradual a moving head appear&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Eagle firemen knew<br />
&rsquo;Twas Joseph Muggins, name revered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The foreman of their crew.<br />
Loud shouted all in signs of woe,<br />
&ldquo;A Muggins! to the rescue, ho!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>And pour&rsquo;d the hissing tide:<br />
Meanwhile the Muggins fought amain,<br />
And strove and struggled all in vain,<br />
For, rallying but to fall again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He totter&rsquo;d, sunk, and died!</p>
<p class="poetry">Did none attempt, before he fell,<br />
To succour one they loved so well?<br />
Yes, Higginbottom did aspire<br />
(His fireman&rsquo;s soul was all on fire)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His brother chief to save;<br />
But ah! his reckless generous ire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Served but to abate his grave!<br />
&rsquo;Mid blazing beams and scalding streams.<br />
Through fire and smoke he dauntless broke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Muggins broke before:<br />
But sulphry stench and boiling drench<br />
Destroying sight o&rsquo;erwhelm&rsquo;d him quite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sunk to rise no more.<br />
Still o&rsquo;er his head, while fate he braved,<br />
His whizzing water-pipe he waved;<br />
&ldquo;Whitford and Mitford, ply your pumps,<br />
You, Clutterbuck, come stir your stumps,<br />
Why are you in such doleful dumps?<br />
A fireman, and afraid of bumps!&mdash;<br />
What are they fear&rsquo;d on? fools! &rsquo;od rot
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;<br />

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> which was organised by the
moral ability of one has been executed by the physical efforts of
many, and <span class="smcap">Drury Lane Theatre</span> is now
complete.&nbsp; Of that part behind the curtain, which has not
yet been destined to glow beneath the brush of the varnisher, or
vibrate to the hammer of the carpenter, little is thought by the
public, and little need be said by the committee.&nbsp; Truth,
however, is not to be sacrificed for the accommodation of either;
and he who should pronounce that our edifice has received its
final embellishment would be disseminating falsehood without
incurring favour, and risking the disgrace of detection without
participating the advantage of success.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>Professions lavishly effused and parsimoniously verified
are alike inconsistent with the precepts of innate rectitude and
the practice of external policy: let it not then be conjectured
that because we are unassuming, we are imbecile; that forbearance
is any indication of despondency, or humility of demerit.&nbsp;
He that is the most assured of success will make the fewest
appeals to favour, and where nothing is claimed that is undue,
nothing that is due will be withheld.&nbsp; A swelling opening is
too often succeeded by an insignificant conclusion.&nbsp;
Parturient mountains have now produced muscipular abortions; and
the auditor who compares incipient grandeur with final vulgarity
is reminded of the pious hawkers of Constantinople, who solemnly
perambulate her streets, exclaiming, &ldquo;In the name of the
Prophet&mdash;figs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of many who think themselves wise, and of some who are thought
wise by others, the exertions are directed to the revival of
mouldering and obscure dramas; to endeavours to exalt that which
is now rare only because it was always worthless, and whose
deterioration, while it condemned it to living obscurity, by a
strange obliquity of moral perception constitutes its title to
posthumous renown.&nbsp; To embody the flying colours of folly,
to arrest evanescence, to give to bubbles the globular
consistency as well as form, to exhibit on the stage the piebald
denizen of the stable, and the half-reasoning parent of combs, to
display the brisk locomotion of Columbine, or the tortuous
attitudinizing of Punch;&mdash;these are the occupations of
others, whose ambition, limited to the applause of unintellectual
fatuity, is too innocuous for the application of satire, and too
humble for the incitement of jealousy.</p>
<p>Our refectory will be found to contain every species of fruit,
from the cooling nectarine and luscious peach to the puny <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>pippin and
the noxious nut.&nbsp; There Indolence may repose, and Inebriety
revel; and the spruce apprentice, rushing in at second account,
may there chatter with impunity; debarred, by a barrier of brick
and mortar, from marring that scenic interest in others, which
nature and education have disqualified him from comprehending
himself.</p>
<p>Permanent stage-doors we have none.&nbsp; That which is
permanent cannot be removed, for, if removed, it soon ceases to
be permanent.&nbsp; What stationary absurdity can vie with that
ligneous barricado, which, decorated with frappant and
tintinnabulant appendages, now serves as the entrance of the
lowly cottage, and now as the exit of a lady&rsquo;s bed-chamber;
at one time insinuating plastic Harlequin into a butcher&rsquo;s
shop, and, at another, yawning, as a flood-gate, to precipitate
the Cyprians of St. Giles&rsquo;s into the embraces of
Macheath?&nbsp; To elude this glaring absurdity, to give to each
respective mansion the door which the carpenter would doubtless
have given, we vary our portal with the varying scene, passing
from deal to mahogany, and from mahogany to oak, as the opposite
claims of cottage, palace, or castle may appear to require.</p>
<p>Amid the general hum of gratulation which flatters us in
front, it is fit that some regard should be paid to the murmurs
of despondence that assail us in the rear.&nbsp; They, as I have
elsewhere expressed it, &ldquo;who live to please,&rdquo; should
not have their own pleasures entirely overlooked.&nbsp; The
children of Thespis are general in their censures of the
architect, its having placed the locality of exit at such a
distance from the oily irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of
him who addresses you.&nbsp; I am, cries the Queen of Terrors,
robbed of my fair proportions.&nbsp; When the king-killing Thane
hints to the breathless auditory the murders he means to
perpetrate, in the castle of Macduff, &ldquo;ere his <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>purpose
cool;&rdquo; so vast is the interval he has to travel before he
can escape from the stage, that his purpose has even time to
freeze.&nbsp; Your condition, cries the Muse of Smiles, is hard,
but it is cygnet&rsquo;s down in comparison with mine.&nbsp; The
peerless peer of capers and congees <a name="citation54a"></a><a
href="#footnote54a" class="citation">[54a]</a> has laid it down
as a rule, that the best good thing uttered by the morning
visitor should conduct him rapidly to the doorway, last
impressions vying in durability with first.&nbsp; But when, on
this boarded elongation, it falls to my lot to say a good thing,
to ejaculate &ldquo;keep moving,&rdquo; or to chant &ldquo;<i>hic
hoc horum genitivo</i>,&rdquo; many are the moments that must
elapse ere I can hide myself from public vision in the recesses
of O. P. or P. S.</p>
<p>To objections like these, captiously urged and querulously
maintained, it is time that equity should conclusively
reply.&nbsp; Deviation from scenic propriety has only to
vituperate itself for the consequences it generates.&nbsp; Let
the actor consider the line of exit as that line beyond which he
should not soar in quest of spurious applause: let him reflect,
that in proportion as he advances to the lamps, he recedes from
nature; that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional
charm from encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box; and
that the bravura of Mandane may produce effect, although the
throat of her who warbles it should not overhang the
orchestra.&nbsp; The Jove of the modern critical Olympus, Lord
Mayor of the theatric sky, <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a> <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>has, <i>ex
cathedr&acirc;</i>, asserted that a natural actor looks upon the
audience part of the theatre as the third side of the chamber he
inhabits.&nbsp; Surely, of the third wall thus fancifully
erected, our actors should, by ridicule or reason, be withheld
from knocking their heads against the stucco.</p>
<p>Time forcibly reminds me that all things which have a limit
must be brought to a conclusion.&nbsp; Let me, ere that
conclusion arrives, recall to your recollection, that the pillars
which rise on either side of me, blooming in virid antiquity,
like two massy evergreens, had yet slumbered in their native
quarry but for the ardent exertions of the individual who called
them into life: to his never-slumbering talents you are indebted
for whatever pleasure this haunt of the Muses is calculated to
afford.&nbsp; If, in defiance of chaotic malevolence, the
destroyer of the temple of Diana yet survives in the name of
Erostratus, surely we may confidently predict that the rebuilder
of the temple of Apollo will stand recorded to distant posterity
in that of&mdash;<span class="smcap">Samuel Whitbread</span>.</p>

<p class="poetry">The Fire King, one day, rather amorous felt;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; He mounted his hot copper filly;<br />
His breeches and boots were of tin, and the belt<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear it should blister his fingers.</p>
<p class="poetry">His wig is of flames curling over his head,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Well powder&rsquo;d with white smoking ashes;<br />
He drinks gunpowder tea, melted sugar of lead,<br />
Cream of tartar, and dines on hot spice gingerbread,<br />

<p class="poetry">Each fire-nymph his kiss from her countenance

<p class="poetry">And who is the housemaid he means to enthral<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; All melted, like butter or bacon!</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! then she look&rsquo;d sour, and indeed well
she might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Vinegar Yard was before her;<br />

Till on one eve, one joyful Monday eve,<br />
As along Charles Street I prepared to walk,<br />
Just at the corner, by the pastrycook&rsquo;s,<br />
I heard a trowel tick against a brick.<br />
I look&rsquo;d me up, and straight a parapet<br />
Uprose at least seven inches o&rsquo;er the planks.<br />
Joy to thee, Drury! to myself I said:<br />
He of Blackfriars&rsquo; Road, <a name="citation66"></a><a

downfall<br />
In loud Hosannahs, and who prophesied<br />

Has proved a lying prophet.&nbsp; From that hour,<br />
As leisure offer&rsquo;d, close to Mr. Spring&rsquo;s<br />
Box-office door, I&rsquo;ve stood and eyed the builders.<br />
They had a plan to render less their labours;<br />
Workmen in olden times would mount a ladder<br />
With hodded heads, but these stretch&rsquo;d forth a pole<br />
From the wall&rsquo;s pinnacle, they plac&rsquo;d a pulley<br />
Athwart the pole, a rope athwart the pulley;<br />
To this a basket dangled; mortar and bricks<br />
Thus freighted, swung securely to the top,<br />
And in the empty basket workmen twain<br />
Precipitate, unhurt, accosted earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! &rsquo;twas a goodly
sound, to hear the people<br />

When tender Beauty, looking for her coach,<br />
Protrudes her gloveless hand, perceives the shower<br />
And draws the tippet closer round her throat,<br />
Perchance her coach stands half a dozen off,<br />
And, ere she mounts the step, the oozing mud<br />
Soaks through her pale kid slipper.&nbsp; On the morrow<br />
She coughs at breakfast, and her gruff papa<br />
Cries, &ldquo;There you go! this comes of playhouses!&rdquo;<br

Laugh the sly wizards, glorying in their stealth,<br />
Quit the black art, and loll in lazy wealth.<br />
See Britain&rsquo;s Algerines, the lottery fry,<br />
Win annual tribute by the annual lie!<br />
Aided by thee&mdash;but whither do I stray?&mdash;<br />
Court, city, borough, own thy sovereign sway;<br />
An age of puffs an age of gold succeeds,<br />
And windy bubbles are the spawn it breeds.</p>

Muse&rsquo;s prayer!<br />
Swell thy loud lungs and wave thy wings of air;<br />

As erst thy roaring son, with eddying gale,<br />
Whirl&rsquo;d Orithyia from her native vale&mdash;<br />

We mortals stalk, like horses in a mill,<br />
Impassive media of atomic will;<br />
Ye stare! then Truth&rsquo;s broad talisman discern&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis demonstration speaks&mdash;attend, and learn!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From floating elements in
chaos hurl&rsquo;d,<br />
Self-form&rsquo;d of atoms, sprang the infant world:<br />
No great <i>First Cause</i> inspired the happy plot,<br />
But all was matter&mdash;and no matter what.<br />
Atoms, attracted by some law occult,<br />
Settling in spheres, the globe was the result;<br />
Pure child of <i>Chance</i>, which still directs the ball,<br />
As rotatory atoms rise or fall.<br />
In ether launch&rsquo;d, the peopled bubble floats,<br />
A mass of particles and confluent motes,<br />
So nicely poised, that if one atom flings<br />
Its weight away, aloft the planet springs,<br />
And wings its course through realms of boundless space.<br />
Outstripping comets in eccentric race<br />
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Add but
one atom more, it sinks outright<br />
Down to the realms of Tartarus and night.<br />
What waters melt or scorching fires consume,<br />
In different forms their being re-assume:<br />
Hence can no change arise, except in name,<br />
For weight and substance ever are the same.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with the flames that
from old Drury rise<br />
Its elements primeval sought the skies;<br />
There pendulous to wait the happy hour<br />
When new attractions should restore their power:<br />
So, in this procreant theatre elate,<br />
Echoes unborn their future life await;<br />
Here embryo sounds in ether lie conceal&rsquo;d,<br />
Like words in northern atmosphere congeal&rsquo;d.<br />
Here many a foetus laugh and half encore<br />
Clings to the roof, or creeps along the floor;<br />
By puffs concipient some in ether flit,<br />
And soar in bravos from the thundering pit;<br />
Some forth on ticket-nights <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a> from tradesmen
break,<br />
To mar the actor they design to make;<br />
While some this mortal life abortive miss,<br />
Crush&rsquo;d by a groan, or strangled by a hiss.<br />
So, when &ldquo;Dog&rsquo;s-meat&rdquo; re-echoes through the
streets,<br />
Rush sympathetic dogs from their retreats,<br />
Beam with bright blaze their supplicating eyes,<br />
Sink their hind-legs, ascend their joyful cries;<br />
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Each, wild
with hope, and maddening to prevail,<br />
Points the pleased ear, and wags the expectant tail.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye fallen bricks! in
Drury&rsquo;s fire calcined,<br />
Since doom&rsquo;d to slumber, couch&rsquo;d upon the wind,<br />
Sweet was the hour, when, tempted by your freaks,<br />
Congenial trowels smooth&rsquo;d your yellow cheeks.<br />
Float dulcet serenades upon the ear,<br />
Bends every atom from its ruddy sphere,<br />
Twinkles each eye, and, peeping from its veil,<br />
Marks in the adverse crowd its destined male.<br />
The oblong beauties clap their hands of grit,<br />
And brick-dust titterings on the breezes flit;<br />
Then down they rush in amatory race,<br />
Their dusty bridegrooms eager to embrace.<br />
Some choose old lovers, some decide for new,<br />
But each, when fix&rsquo;d, is to her station true.<br />
Thus various bricks are made, as tastes invite&mdash;<br />
The red, the grey, the dingy, or the white.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some half-baked
rover, frank and free,<br />
To alien beauty bends the lawless knee,<br />
But of unhallow&rsquo;d fascinations sick,<br />
Soon quite his Cyprian for his married brick;<br />
The Dido atom calls and scolds in vain,<br />
No crisp &AElig;neas soothes the widow&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in Cheapside, what time
Aurora peeps,<br />
A mingled noise of dustmen, milk, and sweeps<br />
Falls on the housemaid&rsquo;s ear: amazed she stands,<br />
Then opes the door with cinder-sabled hands,<br />
And &ldquo;Matches&rdquo; calls.&nbsp; The dustman, bubbled
flat,<br />
Thinks &rsquo;tis for him and doffs his fan-tail&rsquo;d hat; <br
/>
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>The
milkman, whom her second cries assail,<br />
With sudden sink unyokes the clinking pail;<br />
Now louder grown, by turns she screams and weeps&mdash;<br />
Alas! her screaming only brings the sweeps.<br />
Sweeps but put out&mdash;she wants to raise a flame,<br />
And calls for matches, but &rsquo;tis still the same.<br />
Atoms and housemaids! mark the moral true&mdash;<br />
If once ye go astray, no <i>match</i> for you!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As atoms in one mass united

Leaps the red bridegroom to the labourer&rsquo;s hod:<br />

THEATRICAL ALARM-BELL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p>As it is now the universally-admitted, and indeed
pretty-generally-suspected, aim of Mr. Whitbread and the
infamous, bloodthirsty, and, in fact, illiberal faction to which
he belongs, to burn to the ground this free and happy Protestant
city, and establish himself in St. James&rsquo;s Palace, his
fellow committeemen have thought it their duty to watch the
principles of a theatre built under his auspices.&nbsp; The
information they have received from an undoubted
authority&mdash;particularly from an old fruit-woman who has
turned king&rsquo;s evidence, and whose name, for obvious
reasons, we forbear to mention, though we have had it some weeks
in our possession&mdash;has induced them to introduce various
reforms&mdash;not such reforms as the vile faction clamour for,
meaning thereby revolution, but such reforms <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>as are
necessary to preserve the glorious constitution of the only free,
happy, and prosperous country now left upon the face of the
earth.&nbsp; From the valuable and authentic source above alluded
to, we have learnt that a sanguinary plot has been formed by some
United Irishmen, combined with a gang of Luddites, and a special
committee sent over by the Pope at the instigation of the beastly
Corsican fiend, for destroying all the loyal part of the audience
on the anniversary of that
deeply-to-be-abhorred-and-highly-to-be-blamed stratagem, the
Gunpowder Plot, which falls this year on Thursday the fifth of
November.&nbsp; The whole is under the direction of a delegated
committee of O. P.&rsquo;s whose treasonable exploits at Covent
Garden you all recollect, and all of whom would have been hung
from the chandeliers at that time, but for the mistaken lenity of
Government.&nbsp; At a given signal, a well-known O. P. was to
cry out from the gallery, &ldquo;Nosey!&nbsp; Music!&rdquo;
whereupon all the O. P.&rsquo;s were to produce from their inside
pockets a long pair of shears, edged with felt, to prevent their
making any noise, manufactured expressly by a wretch at
Birmingham, one of Mr. Brougham&rsquo;s evidences, and now in
custody.&nbsp; With these they were to cut off the heads of all
the loyal N. P.&rsquo;s in the house, without distinction of sex
or age.&nbsp; At the signal, similarly given, of &ldquo;Throw him
over!&rdquo; which it now appears always alluded to the overthrow
of our
never-sufficiently-enough-to-be-deeply-and-universally-to-be-venerated
constitution, all the heads of the N. P.&rsquo;s were to be
thrown at the fiddlers, to prevent their appearing in evidence,
or perhaps as a false and illiberal insinuation that they have no
heads of their own.&nbsp; All that we know of the further designs
of these incendiaries is, that they are
by-a-great-deal-too-much-too-horrible-to-be-mentioned.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>The
Manager has acted with his usual promptitude on this trying
occasion.&nbsp; He has contracted for 300 tons of gun powder,
which are at this moment placed in a small barrel under the pit;
and a descendant of Guy Faux, assisted by Col. Congreve, has
undertaken to blow up the house, when necessary, in so novel and
ingenious a manner, that every O. P. shall be annihilated, while
not a whisker of the N. P.&rsquo;s shall be singed.&nbsp; This
strikingly displays the advantages of loyalty and attachment to
government.&nbsp; Several other hints have been taken from the
theatrical regulations of the
not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account-to-be-universally-execrated
monster Bonaparte.&nbsp; A park of artillery, provided with
chain-shot, is to be stationed on the stage, and play upon the
audience, in case of any indication of misplaced applause or
popular discontent (which accounts for the large space between
the curtain and the lamps); and the public will participate our
satisfaction in learning that the indecorous custom of standing
up with the hat on is to be abolished, as the Bow-street officers
are provided with daggers, and have orders to stab all such
persons to the heart, and send their bodies to Surgeons&rsquo;
Hall.&nbsp; Gentlemen who cough are only to be slightly
wounded.&nbsp; Fruit-women bawling &ldquo;Bill of the
Play!&rdquo; are to be forthwith shot, for which purpose soldiers
will be stationed in the slips, and ball-cartridge is to be
served out with the lemonade.&nbsp; If any of the spectators
happen to sneeze or spit, they are to be transported for life;
and any person who is so tall as to prevent another seeing, is to
be dragged out and sent on board the tender, or, by an instrument
to be taken out of the pocket of Procrustes, to be forthwith cut
shorter, either at the head or foot, according as his own
convenience may dictate.</p>
<p>Thus, ladies and gentlemen, have the committee, through <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>my medium,
set forth the not-in-a-hurry-to-be-paralleled plan they have
adopted for preserving order and decorum within the walls of
their magnificent edifice.&nbsp; Nor have they, while attentive
to their own concerns, by any means overlooked those of the
cities of London and Westminster.&nbsp; Finding on enumeration
that they have, with a with-two-hands-and-one-tongue-to
be-applauded liberality, contracted for more gunpowder than they
want, they have parted with the surplus to the mattock-carrying
and hustings-hammering high-bailiff of Westminster, who has, with
his own shovel, dug a large hole in the front of the
parish-church of St. Paul, Covent Garden, that, upon the least
symptom of ill-breeding in the mob at the general election, the
whole of the market may be blown into the air.&nbsp; This, ladies
and gentlemen, may at first make provisions <i>rise</i>, but we
pledge the credit of our theatre that they will soon <i>fall</i>
again, and people be supplied, as usual, with vegetables, in the
in-general-strewed-with-cabbage-stalks-but-on-Saturday-night-lighted-up-with-lamps
market of Covent Garden.</p>
<p>I should expatiate more largely on the other advantages of the
glorious constitution of these by-the-whole-of-Europe-envied
realms, but I am called away to take an account of the ladies and
other artificial flowers at a fashionable rout, of which a full
and particular account will hereafter appear.&nbsp; For the
present, my fashionable intelligence is scanty, on account of the
opening of Drury Lane; and the ladies and gentlemen who honour me
will not be surprised to find nothing under my usual head!!</p>

<h4>A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the following poem should be
fortunate enough to be selected for the opening address, a few
words of explanation may be deemed necessary, on my part, to
avert invidious misrepresentation.&nbsp; The animadversion I have
thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning the
orchestra will, I hope, give no lasting remorse to any of the
gentlemen employed in the band.&nbsp; It is to be desired that
they would keep their instruments ready tuned, and strike off at
once.&nbsp; This would be an accommodation to many well-meaning
persons who frequent the theatre, who, not being blest with the
ear of St. Cecilia, mistake the tuning for the overture, and
think the latter concluded before it is begun.</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;One fiddle will<br />
Give, half-ashamed, a tiny flourish still,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was originally written &ldquo;one hautboy will;&rdquo; but,
having providentially been informed, when this poem was on the
point of being sent off, that there is but one hautboy in the
band, I averted the storm of popular and manageria <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>indignation
from the head of its blower: as it now stands, &ldquo;one
fiddle&rdquo; among many, the faulty individual will, I hope,
escape detection.&nbsp; The story of the flying play-bill is
calculated to expose a practice much too common, of pinning
play-bills to the cushions insecurely, and frequently, I fear,
not pinning them at all, if these lines save one play-bill only
front the fate I have recorded, I shall not deem my labour ill
employed.&nbsp; The concluding episode of Patrick Jennings
glances at the boorish fashion of wearing the hat in the
one-shilling gallery.&nbsp; Had Jennings thrust his between his
feet at the commencement of the play, he might have leaned
forward with impunity, and the catastrophe I relate would not
have occurred.&nbsp; The line of handkerchiefs formed to enable
him to recover his loss, is purposely so crossed in texture and
materials as to mislead the reader in respect to the real owner
of any one of them: for, in the statistical view of life and
manners which I occasionally present, my clerical profession has
taught me how extremely improper it would be, by any allusion,
however slight, to give any uneasiness, however trivial, to any
individual, however foolish or wicked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p>Happening to be wool-gathering at the foot of Mount Parnassus,
I was suddenly seized with a violent travestie in the head.&nbsp;
The first symptoms I felt were several triple rhymes floating
about my brain, accompanied by a singing in my throat, which
quickly communicated itself to the ears of everybody about me,
and made me a burthen to my friends and a torment to Doctor
Apollo; three of whose favourite servants&mdash;that is to say,
Macbeth, his butcher; Mrs. Haller, his cook; and George Barnwell,
his book-keeper&mdash;I waylaid in one of my fits of insanity,
and mauled after a very frightful fashion.&nbsp; In this woeful
crisis, I accidentally heard of your invaluable New Patent
Hissing Pit, which cures every disorder incident to Grub
Street.&nbsp; I send you inclosed a more detailed specimen of my
case: if you could mould it into the shape of an address, to be
said or sung on the first night of your performance, I have no
doubt that I should feel the immediate effects of your invaluable
New Patent Hissing Pit, of which they tell me one hiss is a
dose.</p>

A wailing old Methodist, gloomy and wan,<br />
A husband suspicious&mdash;his wife acted Ranger,<br />

Her martial gallant swore that truth was a libel,<br />
That marriage was thraldom, elopement no sin;<br />

Her land fuller&rsquo;s earth, and her great riches

No longer permitted in diamonds to sparkle,<br />
Now plain Mrs. Haller, of servants the dread,<br />
With a heart full of grief, and a pan full of charcoal,<br />

One day, on a bench as dejected and sad he laid,<br />
Hearing a squash, he cried, Damn it, what&rsquo;s that?<br />
&rsquo;Twas a child of the count&rsquo;s, in whose service lived
Adelaide,<br />
Soused in the river, and squall&rsquo;d like a cat.</p>

dinner,<br />
With gunpowder-tea, which you know brings a ball,<br />

Young master and missee besieged their papa;<br />
They sung a quartetto in grand blubberation&mdash;<br />

I have no good moral to give in exchange;<br />
For though she, as a cook, might be given to melting,<br />
The Stranger&rsquo;s behaviour was certainly strange,<br />

published by Mr. Murray.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Preface&rdquo; was

James Smith.</p>

died by his own hand in 1815.</p>
<p><a name="footnote0d"></a><a href="#citation0d"
class="footnote">[0d]</a>&nbsp; This was Horatio, the writer of
the present Preface.&nbsp; The envelope which enclosed his
Address to the Committee was sold with two volumes of the
original Addresses at Mr. Winston&rsquo;s sale, Dec. 14, 1849,
and was inscribed inside &ldquo;Horatio Smith, 36, Basinghall
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote0e"></a><a href="#citation0e"
class="footnote">[0e]</a>&nbsp; The passage, as originally
written, continued thus: &ldquo;and among others, so difficult is
it to form a correct judgment in catering to the public taste, by
the very bibliopolist who has now, after an interval of twenty
[<i>only</i> seven] years, purchased the copyright from a brother
bookseller, and ventured upon the present edition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To this, on the proof-sheet, the late Mr. Murray appended the
following note:&mdash;&ldquo;I never saw or even had the MS. in
my possession; but knowing that Mr. Smith was brother-in-law to
Mr. Cadell, I took it for granted that the MS. had been
previously offered to him and declined.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. H. Smith
consequently drew his pen through the passage.</p>

name of the loyal Mr. Fitzgerald, though as good we suppose as
the original, is not very interesting.&nbsp; Whether it be very

scribblers is well rendered.&rdquo;&mdash;<span

<p><span class="smcap">William Thomas
Fitzgerald</span>.&mdash;The annotator&rsquo;s first personal
knowledge of this gentleman was at Harry Greville&rsquo;s Pic-Nic
Theatre, in Tottenham-street, where he personated Zanga in a wig
too small for his head.&nbsp; The second time of seeing him was
at the table of old Lord Dudley, who familiarly called him Fitz,
but forgot to name him in his will.&nbsp; The Viscount&rsquo;s
son (recently deceased), however, liberally supplied the omission
by a donation of five thousand pounds.&nbsp; The third and last
time of encountering him was at an anniversary dinner of the
Literary Fund, at the Freemasons&rsquo; Tavern.&nbsp; Both
parties, as two of the stewards, met their brethren in a small
room about half an hour before dinner.&nbsp; The lampooner, out
of delicacy, kept aloof from the poet.&nbsp; The latter, however,
made up to him, when the following dialogue took place:</p>
<p>Fitzgerald (with good humour).&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. &mdash;, I
mean to recite after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. &mdash;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fitzgerald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes: you&rsquo;ll have more of
&lsquo;God bless the Regent and the Duke of
York!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole of this imitation, after a lapse of twenty years,
appears to the Authors too personal and sarcastic; but they may
shelter themselves under a very broad mantle:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let hoarse Fitzgerald
bawl<br />
His creaking couplets in a tavern-hall.&rdquo;&mdash;Byron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fitzgerald actually sent in an address to the Committee on the
31st of August, 1812.&nbsp; It was published among the other

mania.&nbsp; The writer was in the stage-box at the height of
this young gentleman&rsquo;s popularity.&nbsp; One of the other
occupants offered, in a loud voice, to prove that Young Betty did
not understand Shakespeare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; was the
cry; but he still proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Turn him out!&rdquo;
was the next ejaculation.&nbsp; He still vociferated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He does not understand Shakespeare;&rdquo; and was
consequently shouldered into the lobby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll

&ldquo;Prove what, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That he does not

<p>Young Betty may now [1833] be seen walking about town&mdash;a

[He is still alive, 1854.&nbsp; Master Betty, or the &ldquo;Young

poet and prophet are synonymous, the noble bard having afterwards
returned to England, and again quitted it, under domestic
circumstances painfully notorious.&nbsp; His good-humoured
forgiveness of the Authors has already been alluded to in the
Preface.&nbsp; Nothing of this illustrious poet, however trivial,
can be otherwise than interesting.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know him
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Mr. Murray&rsquo;s dinner-table the
annotator met him and Sir John Malcolm.&nbsp; Lord Byron talked
of intending to travel in Persia.&nbsp; &ldquo;What must I do
when I set off?&rdquo; said he to Sir John.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut off
your buttons!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My buttons! what, these metal
ones!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes; the Persians are in the main very
honest fellows; but if you go thus bedizened, you will infallibly
be murdered for your buttons!&rdquo;&nbsp; At a dinner at Monk
Lewis&rsquo;s chambers in the Albany, Lord Byron expressed to the
writer his determination not to go there again, adding, &ldquo;I
never will dine with a middle-aged man who fills up his table
with young ensigns, and has looking-glass panels to his
book-cases.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Byron, when one of the Drury-lane
Committee of Management, challenged the writer to sing
alternately (like the swains in Virgil) the praises of Mrs.
Mardyn, the actress, who, by-the-bye, was hissed off the stage
for an imputed intimacy of which she was quite innocent.</p>
<p>The contest ran as fellows:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Wake, muse of fire, your ardent lyre,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour forth your amorous ditty,<br />
But first profound, in duly bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Applaud the new Committee;<br />
Their scenic art from Thespis&rsquo; cart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All jaded nags discarding,<br />
To London drove this queen of love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enchanting Mrs. Mardyn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though tides of love around her rove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear she&rsquo;ll choose Pactolus&mdash;<br />
In that bright surge bards ne&rsquo;er immerge.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So I must e&rsquo;en swim solus.<br />
&lsquo;Out, out, alas!&rsquo; ill-fated gas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That shin&rsquo;st round Covent Garden,<br />
Thy ray how flat, compared with that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From eye of Mrs. Mardyn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on.&nbsp; The reader has, no doubt, already discovered
&ldquo;which is the justice, and which is the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Byron at that time wore a very narrow cravat of white
sarsnet, with the shirt-collar falling over it; a black coat and
waist-coat, and very broad white trousers to hide his lame
foot&mdash;these were of Russia duck in the morning, and jean in
the evening.&nbsp; His watch-chain had a number of small gold
seals appended to it, and was looped up to a button of his
waistcoat.&nbsp; His face was void of colour; he wore no
whiskers.&nbsp; His eyes were grey, fringed with long black
lashes; and his air was imposing, but rather supercilious.&nbsp;
He under-valued David Hume; denying his claim to genius on
account of his bulk, and calling him, from the Heroic
Epistle,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fattest hog in Epicurus&rsquo;
sly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of this extraordinary man&rsquo;s allegations was, that
&ldquo;fat is an oily dropsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; To stave off its
visitation, he frequently chewed tobacco in lieu of dinner,
alleging that it absorbed the gastric juice of the stomach, and
prevented hunger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pass your hand down my
side,&rdquo; said his Lordship to the writer; &ldquo;can you
count my ribs?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every one of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am delighted to hear you say
so.&nbsp; I called last week on Lady &mdash;; &lsquo;Ah, Lord
Byron,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;how fat you grow!&rsquo;&nbsp; But
you know Lady &mdash; is fond of saying spiteful
timings!&rdquo;&nbsp; Let this gossip be summed up with the words
of Lord Chesterfield, in his character of Bolingbroke:
&ldquo;Upon the whole, on a survey of this extraordinary
character, what can we say, but &lsquo;Alas, poor human
nature!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His favourite Pope&rsquo;s description of man is applicable to
Byron individually:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chaos of thought and passion all
confused,<br />
Still by himself abused or disabused;<br />
Created part to rise and part to fall,<br />
Great lord of all things, yet a slave to all;<br />
Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled&mdash;<br />
The glory, jest, and riddle of the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer never heard him allude to his deformed foot except
upon one occasion, when, entering the green-room of Drury-lane,
he found Lord Byron alone, the younger Byrne and Miss Smith the
dancer having just left him, after an angry conference about a
<i>pas suel</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had you been here a minute
sooner,&rdquo; said Lord B., &ldquo;you would have heard a
question about dancing referred to me:&mdash;me! (looking
mournfully downward) whom fate from my birth has prohibited from
taking a single step.&rdquo;</p>

edifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The late theatre was built by Holland the
architect.&nbsp; The writer visited it on the night of its
opening [April 21, 1794].&nbsp; The performances were
<i>Macbeth</i> and the <i>Virgin Unmasked</i>.&nbsp; Between the
play and the farce, an excellent epilogue, written by George
Colman, was excellently spoken by Miss Farren.&nbsp; It referred
to the iron curtain which was, in the event of fire, to be let
down between the stage and the audience, and which accordingly
descended, by way of experiment, leaving Miss Farren between the
lamps and the curtain.&nbsp; The fair speaker informed the
audience, that should the fire break out on the stage (where it
usually originates), it would thus be kept from the spectators;
adding, with great solemnity&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No! we assure our generous benefactors<br
/>
&rsquo;Twill only burn the scenery and the actors!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tank of water was afterwards exhibited, in the course of the
epilogue, in which a wherry was rowed by a real live man, the
band playing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And did you not hear of a jolly young
waterman?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Farren reciting&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sit still, there&rsquo;s
nothing in it,<br />
We&rsquo;ll undertake to drown you in a single minute.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;O vain thought!&rdquo; as Othello says.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the boast in the epilogue&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blow, wind&mdash;come, rack, in ages yet
unborn,<br />
Our castle&rsquo;s strength shall laugh a siege to
scorn&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the theatre fell a victim to the flames within fifteen years
from the prognostic!&nbsp; These preparations against fire always
presuppose presence of mind and promptness in those who are to
put them into action.&nbsp; They remind one of the dialogue, in
Morton&rsquo;s <i>Speed the Plough</i>, between Sir Able Handy
and his son Bob:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Bob</i>.&nbsp; Zounds, the
castle&rsquo;s on fire!</p>
<p><i>Sir A</i>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><i>Bob</i>.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s your patent liquid for
extinguishing fire?</p>
<p><i>Sir A</i>.&nbsp; It is not mixed.</p>
<p><i>Bob</i>.&nbsp; Then where&rsquo;s your patent
fire-escape?</p>
<p><i>Sir A</i>.&nbsp; It is not fixed.</p>
<p><i>Bob</i>.&nbsp; You are never at a loss?</p>
<p><i>Sir A</i>.&nbsp; Never.</p>
<p><i>Bob</i>.&nbsp; Then what do you mean to do?</p>

is alleged to have growled like a bull-dog, requires rather a
lengthened note, for the edification of the rising
generation.&nbsp; The &ldquo;horns, rattles, drums,&rdquo; with
which he is accompanied, are no inventions of the poet.&nbsp; The
new Covent Garden Theatre opened on the 18th Sept., 1809, when a
cry of &ldquo;Old Prices&rdquo; (afterwards diminished to O. P.)
burst out from every part of the house.&nbsp; This continued and
increased in violence till the 23rd, when rattles, drums,
whistles, and cat-calls having completely drowned the voices of
the actors, Mr. Kemble, the stage-manager, came forward and said
that a committee of gentlemen had undertaken to examine the
finances of the concern, and that until they were prepared with
their report the theatre would continue closed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Name
them!&rdquo; was shouted from all sides.&nbsp; The names were
declared, viz., Sir Charles Price, the Solicitor-General, the
Recorder of London, the Governor of the Bank, and Mr.
Angerstein.&nbsp; &ldquo;All shareholders!&rdquo; bawled a wag
from the gallery.&nbsp; In a few days the theatre re-opened: the
public paid no attention to the report of the referees, and the
tumult was renewed for several weeks with even increased
violence.&nbsp; The proprietors now sent in hired bruisers, to
<i>mill</i> the refractory into subjection.&nbsp; This irritated
most of their former friends, and, amongst the root, the
annotator, who accordingly wrote the song of &ldquo;Heigh-ho,
says Kemble,&rdquo; which was caught up by the ballad-singers,
and sung under Mr. Kemble&rsquo;s house-windows in Great
Russell-street.&nbsp; A dinner was given at the Crown and Anchor
Tavern in the Strand, to celebrate the victory obtained by W.
Clifford in his action against Brandon the box-keeper, for
assaulting him for wearing the letters O. P. in his hat.&nbsp; At
this dinner Mr. Kemble attended, and matters were compromised by
allowing the advanced price (seven shillings) to the boxes.&nbsp;
The writer remembers a former riot of a similar sort at the same
theatre (in the year 1792), when the price to the boxes was
raised from five shillings to six.&nbsp; That tumult, however,
only lasted three nights.</p>

happened to be at the Royal Circus when &ldquo;God save the
King&rdquo; was called for, accompanied by a cry of &ldquo;Stand

lieutenant, perceiving a gentleman in an adjoining box slow to
obey the call, struck his hat off with his stick, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Take off your hat, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; The other thus
assaulted proved to be, unluckily for the lieutenant, Lord
Camelford, the celebrated bruiser and duellist.&nbsp; A set-to in
the lobby was the consequence, where his lordship quickly proved
victorious.&nbsp; &ldquo;The devil is not so black as he is
painted,&rdquo; said one of the Authors to the other; &ldquo;let

ornaments strongly expressive of the pugnacity of the peer.&nbsp;

hooks.&nbsp; Above this was placed parallel one of lesser
dimensions, until a pyramid of weapons gradually arose, tapering
to a horsewhip:</p>

<p>Lord Camelford received his visitants with great civility, and
thanked them warmly for the call; adding, that their evidence
would be material, it being his intention to indict the
lieutenant for an assault.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I can say in return
is this,&rdquo; exclaimed the peer with great cordiality,
&ldquo;if ever I see you engaged in a row, upon my soul

Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s argument is, like many of his other
arguments, specious, but untenable; that which it defends has
since been abandoned as impracticable.&nbsp; Mr. Whitbread
contended that the actor was like a portrait in a picture, and
accordingly placed the green curtain in a gilded frame remote
from the foot-lights; alleging that no performer should mar the
illusion by stepping out of the frame.&nbsp; Dowton was the first
actor who, like Manfred&rsquo;s ancestor in the <i>Castle of

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Gregory Lewis</span>, commonly
called <i>Monk</i> Lewis, from his once popular romance of that
name, was a good-hearted man, and, like too many of that
fraternity, a disagreeable one&mdash;verbose, disputatious and
paradoxical.&nbsp; His <i>Monk</i> and <i>Castle Spectre</i>
elevated him into fame; and he continued to write ghost-stories
till, following as he did in the wake of Mrs. Radcliffe, he quite
overstocked the market.&nbsp; Lewis visited his estates in
Jamaica, and came back perfectly negro-bitten.&nbsp; He
promulgated a new code of laws in the island, for the government
of his sable subjects: one may serve for a specimen: &ldquo;Any
slave who commits murder shall have his heed shaved, and be
confined three days and nights in a dark room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon
occasion of printing these parodies, <i>Monk</i> Lewis said to
Lady H[olland], &ldquo;Many of them are very fair, but mine is
not at all like; they have made me write burlesque, which I never
do&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your own talent,&rdquo;
answered the lady.</p>
<p>Lewis aptly described himself, as to externals, in the verses
affixed to his <i>Monk</i>, as having</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A graceless form and dwarfish
stature&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had, moreover, large grey eyes, thick features, and an
inexpressive countenance.&nbsp; In talking, he had a disagreeable
habit of drawing the fore-finger of his right hand across his
tight eye-lid.&nbsp; He affected, in conversation, a sort of
dandified, drawling tone: young Harlowe, the artist, did the
same.&nbsp; A foreigner who had but slight knowledge of the
English language might have concluded, from their cadences, that
they were little better than fools&mdash;&ldquo;just a born
goose,&rdquo; as Terry the actor used to say.&nbsp; Lewis died on
his passage homeward from Jamaica, owing to a dose of
James&rsquo;s powders injudiciously administered by &ldquo;his
own mere motion.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote various plays, with
various success, he had admirable notions of dramatic
construction, but the goodness of his scenes and incidents was
marred by the badness of his dialogue.</p>

writer&rsquo;s first interview with this poet, who may be

Spencer&rsquo;s villa at Petersham, close to what that gentleman
called his gold-fish pond, though it was scarcely three feet in
diameter, throwing up a <i>jet d&rsquo;eau</i> like a
thread.&nbsp; The venerable bard, seizing both the hands of his
satirist exclaimed with a good-humoured laugh, &ldquo;Ah! my old
enemy, how do you do?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of conversation,
he expressed great astonishment at his popularity in London;
adding, &ldquo;In my own village they think nothing of
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The subject happening to be the inroads of time
upon beauty, the writer quoted the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Six years had pass&rsquo;d, and forty ere
the six,<br />
When Time began to play his usual tricks:<br />
My locks, once comely in a virgin&rsquo;s sight,<br />
Locks of pure brown, now felt th&rsquo; encroaching white;<br />
Gradual each day I liked my horses less,<br />
My dinner more&mdash;I learnt to play at chess.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good!&rdquo; cried the
bard;&mdash;&ldquo;whose to it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed! hah! well, I had quite forgotten
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was this affectation, or was it not?&nbsp; In
sooth, he seemed to push simplicity to puerility.&nbsp; This
imitation contained in manuscript the following lines, after
describing certain Sunday newspaper critics who were supposed to
be present at a new play, and who were rather heated in their
politics:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hard is the task who edits&mdash;thankless
job!&mdash;<br />
A Sunday journal for the factious mob<br />
With bitter paragraph and caustic jest,<br />
He gives to turbulence the day of rest;<br />
Condemn&rsquo;d, this week, rash rancour to instil,<br />
Or thrown aside, the next, for one who will:<br />
Alike undone or if he praise or rail<br />
(For this affects his safety, that his sale),<br />
He sinks at last, in luckless limbo set,<br />
If loud for libel, and if dumb for debt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were, however, never printed; being, on reflection,
considered too serious for the occasion.</p>
<p>It is not a little extraordinary that Crabbe, who could write
with such rigour, should descend to such lines as the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Something bad happen&rsquo;d wrong about a
bill<br />
Which was not drawn with true mercantile skill,<br />
So, to amend it, I was told to go<br />
And seek the firm of Clutterbuck and Co.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely &ldquo;Emanuel Jennings,&rdquo; compared with the
above, rises to sublimity.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;&lsquo;The Theatre,&rsquo; by the Rev. G. Crabbe, we
rather think, is the best piece in the collection.&nbsp; It is an
exquisite and most masterly imitation, not only of the peculiar
style, but of the taste, temper, and manner of description of
that most original author; and can hardly be said to be in any
respect a caricature of that style or manner&mdash;except in the
excessive profusion of puns and verbal jingles&mdash;which,
though undoubtedly to be ranked among his characteristics, are
never so thick sown in his original works as in this admirable
imitation.&nbsp; It does not aim, of course, at any shadow of his
pathos or moral sublimity, but seems to us to be a singularly
faithful copy of his passages of mere
description,&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jeffrey</span>,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
